### Full-Stack Web Development

Full Stack Web Development is a web development practice that encapsulates both front-end (visual) and back-end (server) techniques without making them seperate tasks/roles.

Benefits of Full Stack:

- Saves companies money _(when you combine front-end and back-end roles together, you don't have to pay for two seperate roles!)_
- Developer can work faster and better understand the project _(even though they take on two roles, they take the reigns on entire project and don't need to slow down and understand new code other people submit or change)_.

### Node.js Understanding

Node.JS is a "server-side" JS envoirnment that allows developers to use JS both for front and back-end development.

Node.JS offers many benefits and features:

1. Completes multiple tasks at once instead of handling tasks one by one in a sequence _(aka Non-Blocking IO)_
2. Contains NPM _(Node Package Manager)_ that offers access to tons of libraries upon install.
3. Node is driven by events and responds to users actions in real-time, making it essential for use in real-time applications

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Git and GitHub are two version control systems that have revolutionized the way developers share and collaborate on code. With Git and/or GitHub, developers can...

- [x] Create "branches" of a project to test code changes without altering the "main" project,
- [x] Integrate control in their code editor _(such as Visual Studio Code)_ and easily "push" _(send)_ or "pull" _(receieve)_ code changes without leaving the editor,
- [x] Share and distribute code on the web to allow collaboration regardless of OS or location,
- [ ] Make coffee.

### Markdown & Documentation

Documentation is ==ESSENTIAL== for each and every web project regardless of its scope or purpose. While you, the developer, may understand the ins and outs of your code, another developer may not. Providing context for your code and properly documenting your project using markdown files _(.md)_ can not only help potential collaborators understand your project but it can also assist you in your own understanding of what exactly you're creating by documenting your project journey.

A majority of developers use `README.md` files for documentation. Some common information provided in these markdown files include...

| For Others                          | For You                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Installing and running your project | What you learned                                       |
| Project purpose/use                 | Tools/solutions you wished you used or knew of earlier |
| Known errors                        |                                                        |
